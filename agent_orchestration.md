                         DELIVERABLES:
                         1. Multi-level caching system with smart precomputation
                         2. Zero-downtime hot reload system
                         3. Gradual traffic migration for updates
                         4. Performance monitoring and prediction system
                         5. Plugin version management with rollback
                         6. Comprehensive benchmarking suite
                         7. Memory optimization and resource management
                         8. Performance analysis and optimization guides

                         Work closely with all agents to optimize their components. Focus on achieving maximum performance while maintaining reliability and
                          zero downtime.)
