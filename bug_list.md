  Error: table agents has no column named role

● I'll help you investigate this database schema issue. The error indicates that the agents table is missing a role column that the code is trying to use.

● The error you're encountering suggests that the Claude Flow system is trying to insert data into an agents table with a role column, but this column doesn't exist in the database schema. Based on
   my search, this codebase appears to be a wrapper around the claude-flow@alpha npm package, and the actual database operations are likely happening within that package.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Check if claude-flow@alpha package has recent updates that changed the database schema
     ☐ Look for any database initialization or migration commands in the documentation
     ☐ Search for any setup or installation steps that might initialize the database

● The issue is occurring because the Hive Mind system requires database initialization before use. The agents table needs to have a role column, but it appears the database wasn't properly
  initialized.

● The database has been initialized successfully! Now you can run the hive-mind wizard again to create your swarm:

  npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard

  The error was happening because the Hive Mind system requires database initialization before first use. The hive-mind init command creates the necessary SQLite database with all required tables
  including the agents table with the role column.
