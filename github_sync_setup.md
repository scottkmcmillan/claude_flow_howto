# GitHub Integration Setup for Claude Flow

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up GitHub integration with Claude Flow, allowing you to use AI-powered swarms to manage repositories, pull requests, issues, and releases.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Flow installed (`npx claude-flow@alpha`)
- GitHub account with repository access
- Terminal or command prompt access

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. **Log in to GitHub** and go to your account settings
2. **Navigate to Developer Settings**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right
   - Select "Settings"
   - Scroll down and click on "Developer settings" in the left sidebar

3. **Access Personal Access Tokens**:
   - Click on "Personal access tokens"
   - Select "Fine-grained tokens" (recommended) or "Classic tokens"

4. **Generate a new token**:
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - For fine-grained tokens: Give it a name, set an expiration, and select the specific repositories you want to access
   - For classic tokens: Give it a name, set an expiration, and select the required scopes

5. **Set permissions**:
   - For Claude Flow GitHub integration, you'll need permissions for:
     - Repository contents (read/write)
     - Pull requests (read/write)
     - Issues (read/write)
     - If using workflows: Workflow permissions

6. **Generate the token**:
   - Click "Generate token" at the bottom
   - **Important**: Copy the token immediately as GitHub will only show it once

## Step 2: Add the Token to Your Environment

Choose one of these methods to add your token to your environment:

### Option 1: Direct export in terminal (temporary, session only)

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### Option 2: Add to .env file (more permanent)

```bash
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here" >> .env
```

### Option 3: Add to your shell profile (most permanent)

Add the export command to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```bash
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc  # to reload the file
```

## Step 3: Initialize Claude Flow with GitHub Integration

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha init --github
```

## Step 4: Verify GitHub Integration

To verify your GitHub integration is working or to have claude set it up,then:

```bash
# Check repository information
npx claude-flow@alpha github repo-architect "Check repository structure"
```
This should set up the github workflow and create the CLI

# Or try a simple PR listing
npx claude-flow@alpha github pr-manager "List pull requests

You should see output confirming successful authentication and connection to your GitHub account. The command requires an objective parameter that describes what you want to do.

## Using GitHub Integration with Claude Flow

### Important Note About GitHub Commands

The documentation in this guide describes the intended functionality of Claude Flow's GitHub integration. However, **the current alpha version may have limited GitHub functionality** compared to what's described in the documentation.

When you try commands like `github issue-solver`, you might receive an error: `Unknown GitHub mode: issue-solver`. This indicates that some features are still being implemented or may require additional setup.

### Solving GitHub Issues Using Swarms

Instead of using specific GitHub commands that may not be available yet, you can use the general swarm command to work with GitHub issues:

```bash
# Use a swarm to analyze and solve a GitHub issue
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Analyze and fix GitHub issue #1" --research

# Create a solution for a specific issue
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Implement a solution for issue #1" --strategy development
```

### Alternative GitHub Workflow

You can also use Claude Flow to assist with GitHub workflows manually:

```bash
# Get Claude Flow to analyze a GitHub issue
npx claude-flow@alpha "Analyze GitHub issue #123 and suggest solutions"

# Generate code for a PR
npx claude-flow@alpha "Generate code for a PR that implements feature X"
```

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create issue (if it doesn't exist)
npx claude-flow@alpha "Create GitHub issue for adding user authentication"

# 2. Implement with swarm
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Implement user authentication from issue #123" \
  --link-issue 123

# 3. Create PR
npx claude-flow@alpha "Create PR for implementing user authentication from issue #123"

# 4. Coordinate review
npx claude-flow@alpha "Coordinate review for PR #456"

# 5. Merge and release
npx claude-flow@alpha "Merge PR #456 and release v2.1.0"
```

## Additional Integration Tokens

When working with GitHub integration, you may encounter messages about configuring additional tokens for enhanced functionality:

### Codecov and Snyk Integration

You might see this message: "Remember to configure the required secrets (CODECOV_TOKEN, SNYK_TOKEN) in your GitHub repository settings for full functionality."

These tokens provide additional capabilities:

1. **CODECOV_TOKEN**: For [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) integration, which provides code coverage reporting to show how much of your code is being tested.

2. **SNYK_TOKEN**: For [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) integration, a security platform that helps find and fix vulnerabilities in your code, dependencies, and containers.

To configure these tokens in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each token with its appropriate name (CODECOV_TOKEN or SNYK_TOKEN) and value

Note: These integrations are optional and enhance your workflow with automated code quality and security checks, but they're not required for the core GitHub functionality with Claude Flow.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your GitHub token** to a public repository
2. **Set an expiration date** for your token
3. **Use the principle of least privilege** - only grant the permissions needed
4. **Rotate tokens periodically** for enhanced security
5. **Consider using GitHub's organization secrets** for team environments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify your token has the correct permissions
   - Check that the token is correctly set in your environment
   - Ensure the token hasn't expired

2. **Repository Access Issues**
   - Confirm your token has access to the specific repositories
   - Check organization permissions if working with org repositories

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - GitHub API has rate limits; if you hit them, wait or use authenticated requests

### Getting Help

For additional assistance, run:

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha help github
