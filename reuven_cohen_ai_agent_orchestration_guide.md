This section presents Reuven Cohen's actual coordinated multi-agent execution system for implementing a complex plugin system architecture. This real-world example demonstrates his sophisticated orchestration methodology in action, showing how 5 specialized agents coordinate through memory systems to build enterprise-grade software.

#### System Overview

Cohen's approach spawns 5 Claude agents concurrently, each with specialized roles and coordination protocols:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Multi-Agent Coordination Hub               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Agent 1: Core Plugin Foundation Architect               │
│ Agent 2: WASM Security Runtime Specialist              │
│ Agent 3: MCP Integration Bridge Developer               │
│ Agent 4: Plugin Registry & AI Discovery System         │
│ Agent 5: Performance Optimization & Hot Reload         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
