# Claude Flow AI Development Management Guide
*Best Practices for Human Directors Using SPARC Methodology*

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive best practices for human AI development managers directing Claude Flow projects using Reuven's SPARC methodology and other proven development processes. Based on extensive research of official documentation, LinkedIn posts, and real-world implementations.

## SPARC Methodology - The Core Framework

**Note**: SPARC is implemented as `claude-sparc.sh` script, not as npx commands. The script automates all 5 phases.

### The 5 SPARC Phases for AI Development Management

#### Phase 0: Research & Discovery
**Purpose**: Comprehensive domain research and technology analysis
- Use parallel web research with BatchTool and WebFetchTool
- Conduct technology stack analysis and competitive research
- Gather implementation patterns and architectural examples
- Study existing solutions and industry trends

**Commands**:
```bash
# SPARC is implemented as a shell script, not npx command
./claude-sparc.sh "your project description"

# With specific options
./claude-sparc.sh --research-depth comprehensive my-project requirements.md
```

**Deliverables**:
- Technology stack recommendations
- Implementation pattern library
- Competitive analysis report
- Best practices documentation

#### Phase 1: Specification
**Purpose**: Define clear, testable requirements before implementation
- Capture all functional and non-functional requirements
- Define acceptance criteria and identify edge cases
- Create user stories and scenarios
- Establish technical constraints and performance targets

**Process**:
```bash
# SPARC specification phase is part of the automated script
./claude-sparc.sh --mode full auth-system requirements.md
```

**Example Output Structure**:
```markdown
## System Specification
### Functional Requirements
1. User Registration
   - Email/password registration
   - OAuth2 provider support (Google, GitHub)
   - Email verification required
   - Password strength validation

2. Authentication
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Refresh token support
   - Session management
   - Multi-device support

### Test Scenarios
- Valid registration flow
- Duplicate email handling
- Invalid password formats
- OAuth2 callback handling
- Token expiration and refresh
```

#### Phase 2: Pseudocode
**Purpose**: Design algorithms and logic flow before coding
- Plan implementation logic and identify data structures
- Design algorithms and validate approach feasibility
- Create high-level architecture and data flow
- Define error handling and recovery strategies

**Process**:
```bash
# Pseudocode phase is automated within SPARC script
./claude-sparc.sh --verbose token-service algorithm-spec.md
```

**Example Output**:
```
ALGORITHM: Secure Token Refresh with Race Condition Prevention
FUNCTION refreshToken(refreshToken):
  START TRANSACTION
    // Validate refresh token
    IF NOT validateTokenSignature(refreshToken):
      RETURN error("Invalid token")
    
    // Check token in database with row lock
    token = SELECT * FROM refresh_tokens 
            WHERE token = refreshToken FOR UPDATE
    
    IF NOT token OR token.used:
      ROLLBACK
      RETURN error("Token already used or invalid")
    
    // Generate new tokens and update database
    newAccessToken = generateJWT(userId, "15m")
    newRefreshToken = generateRefreshToken()
    
  COMMIT TRANSACTION
  RETURN tokens
END FUNCTION
```

#### Phase 3: Architecture
**Purpose**: Create detailed system design and component specifications
- Define component architecture and interface definitions
- Design data architecture and access patterns
- Plan infrastructure architecture and CI/CD pipeline
- Establish security architecture and compliance requirements

**Key Components**:
- Component specifications with detailed interfaces
- Database design and optimization strategies
- Infrastructure and deployment architecture
- Security controls and access management

#### Phase 4: Refinement (TDD Implementation)
**Purpose**: Implement using Test-Driven Development with quality gates
- Use parallel development tracks (backend, frontend, integration)
- Implement TDD London School with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Apply automated quality gates (linting, analysis, security scans)
- Focus on performance optimization and benchmarking

**TDD Process**:
1. Write failing test (Red)
2. Write minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor and optimize (Refactor)
4. Repeat in short cycles (<15 minutes)

#### Phase 5: Completion
**Purpose**: System integration and production readiness
- Conduct end-to-end testing and requirement validation
- Create comprehensive documentation (API docs, deployment guides)
- Ensure production readiness with monitoring and alerting
- Execute automated deployment with validation

### Advanced Hooks System (v2.0.0-alpha.16)

The Claude Flow hooks system provides automated workflow orchestration by intercepting key operations and executing custom logic before and after critical actions. It includes 14 fully implemented hook types for comprehensive lifecycle management.

#### Core Hook Categories

**Task Management Hooks:**
```bash
# Preparation, complexity estimation, auto-agent spawning
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Implement user authentication" --priority high

# Performance analysis, insights generation, cleanup
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "task-123" --status completed --generate-insights
```

**File Operation Hooks:**
```bash
# Validation, backup, conflict checking, agent assignment
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-edit --file "src/auth.js" --backup true --operation "update authentication logic"

# Auto-formatting, memory updates, neural training
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "src/auth.js" --memory-key "auth/implementation" --format true
```

**Session Management Hooks:**
```bash
# Context loading, memory restoration
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-start --restore-context --load-agents

# Metrics export, summary generation, state persistence
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --save-state --generate-report --cleanup

# Restore previous session state
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "session-123"
```

**Advanced Coordination Hooks:**
```bash
# Query optimization, caching
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-search --query "authentication patterns" --cache true

# Agent coordination messages
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notification --message "Task completed" --agents "all"

# Performance metric tracking
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks performance --operation "database-query" --track-memory

# Cross-agent memory synchronization
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks memory-sync --namespace "project/auth" --agents "coder,tester"

# Event and metrics reporting
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks telemetry --event "task-completion" --metrics '{"duration":1200}'
```

#### Automatic Integration with Claude Code
Hooks integrate seamlessly through `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "preEditHook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-flow@alpha", "hooks", "pre-edit", "--file", "$CLAUDE_EDITED_FILE", "--auto-assign-agents", "true"]
    },
    "postEditHook": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["claude-flow@alpha", "hooks", "post-edit", "--file", "$CLAUDE_EDITED_FILE", "--format", "true"]
    },
    "sessionEndHook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-flow@alpha", "hooks", "session-end", "--generate-summary", "true"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### GitHub-Enhanced Transparency (Alpha 80)
The GitHub hooks feature provides revolutionary transparency by:
- **File Operations**: Creating GitHub releases for every file operation with complete diffs, agent details, and context
- **Task Initialization**: Tracking task descriptions, IDs, assigned agents, start times, and related memory state
- **Memory Operations**: Versioning all memory changes, namespace updates, cross-agent communications, and decision rationale
- **Session Management**: Complete session tracking with start/end times, all operations performed, agent coordination patterns, and comprehensive summaries in `summary-session.md`

#### Development Process Patterns

**1. Continuous Integration Pattern:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "customHooks": {
      "postEdit": {
        "pattern": "*.test.js",
        "command": "npm test -- --findRelatedTests ${file}",
        "continueOnError": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern:**
```bash
# Master coordinator
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Refactor authentication system" --metadata '{"agents":["architect","coder","tester"]}'

# Agent registration
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks agent-spawn --type "architect" --parent-task "task-123"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks agent-spawn --type "coder" --parent-task "task-123"

# Coordination through hooks
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "architecture.md" --sync-agents --memory-key "refactor/architecture"
```

**3. Performance Monitoring Pattern:**
```bash
# Before critical operations
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks perf-start --operation "database-query" --track-memory

# After operations
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks perf-end --operation "database-query" --alert-threshold 1000 --store-metrics
```

**4. Memory-Driven Development Pattern:**
```bash
# Start with context restoration
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-start --restore-context

# Automatic memory updates during development
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "feature.js" --memory-key "feature/implementation"

# End with state preservation
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --save-state
```

#### Variable Interpolation Fix
For Claude Code 1.0.51+, use the fix command to update variable syntax:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha fix-hook-variables
```
This transforms legacy variables:
- `${file}` → `$CLAUDE_EDITED_FILE`
- `${command}` → `$CLAUDE_COMMAND`
- `${tool}` → `$CLAUDE_TOOL`

#### Key Benefits in Development Process
1. **Automated Task Management**: Every operation gets unique tracking IDs and context
2. **Memory Persistence**: Cross-session continuity with automatic context restoration
3. **Agent Coordination**: Synchronizes multi-agent workflows with conflict resolution
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks execution times and resource usage automatically
5. **Quality Assurance**: Automatic validation, formatting, and backup creation
6. **Transparency**: Complete audit trail of all development operations
7. **Neural Learning**: Continuous improvement from successful operation patterns
