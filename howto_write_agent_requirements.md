Based on my comprehensive research across product management, engineering, and computer science domains, I'll now provide a detailed guide on determining requirements for agentic software application-based systems.

# Requirements Engineering for Agentic Multi-Agent Systems: A Comprehensive Guide

## Understanding Agentic Systems and Their Unique Requirements

Agentic software systems represent a paradigm shift from traditional deterministic applications to autonomous, goal-driven entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act independently. Unlike conventional software that follows predetermined workflows, agentic systems operate with varying levels of autonomy, making decisions and adapting their behavior based on environmental changes and feedback.[1][2][3]

## Core Principles for Requirements Gathering in Agentic Systems

### 1. Goal-Oriented Requirements Instead of Task-Oriented

Traditional software development focuses on breaking down requirements into discrete tasks and user stories. However, agentic systems require a fundamental shift toward defining **goals and outcomes** rather than specific processes.[2][4]

**Traditional Approach:**
- "The system shall display a login form with username and password fields"
- "Upon successful authentication, redirect user to dashboard"

**Agentic Approach:**
- "The system shall autonomously ensure secure user access to personalized content"
- "The agent shall maintain user session security while optimizing user experience"

This goal-oriented methodology allows agents to determine the best path to achieve objectives rather than following rigid procedural steps.[4]

### 2. Context-Aware Requirements Engineering

Agentic AI thrives on situational awareness, requiring requirements that capture environmental inputs, dynamic constraints, and contextual triggers. Requirements gathering must extend beyond traditional functional specifications to include:[4]

**Environmental Context Requirements:**
- What environmental signals will the agent monitor?
- How should the agent adapt behavior based on changing conditions?
- What contextual information is critical for decision-making?

**Behavioral Context Requirements:**
- Define "good behavior" patterns in various scenarios
- Specify feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms
- Establish triggers for different behavioral modes[5][4]

### 3. Autonomous Decision Boundaries and Constraints

Unlike static systems, agentic AI can overstep boundaries if not properly constrained. Requirements must explicitly define:[4]

**Operational Boundaries:**
- What actions must the agent never perform?
- Where does human oversight step in?
- What are the "safe stops" in autonomous loops?
- How should the agent escalate uncertain situations?[4]

**Ethical and Legal Constraints:**
- Compliance requirements for autonomous decision-making
- Data privacy and security boundaries
- Regulatory compliance in autonomous operations[6][4]

## Multi-Agent System Requirements Framework

### 1. Agent Role and Responsibility Definition

Each agent in a multi-agent system requires clearly defined roles, capabilities, and interaction protocols. Requirements should specify:[7][8][5]

**Individual Agent Requirements:**
- Specific domain expertise and capabilities
- Decision-making authority and scope
- Resource access and limitations
- Communication protocols with other agents[9][5]

**Inter-Agent Coordination Requirements:**
- Collaboration patterns and workflows
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Information sharing protocols
- Task handoff procedures[5][9]

### 2. System-Level Architecture Requirements

Multi-agent systems require sophisticated orchestration and coordination mechanisms. Key architectural requirements include:[10][11]

**Orchestration Requirements:**
- Central coordination vs. decentralized decision-making
- Agent discovery and registration mechanisms
- Load balancing and scaling policies
- Failure recovery and resilience patterns[11][9]

**Communication and Integration Requirements:**
- Message passing protocols and formats
- API specifications for tool integration
- Data consistency and synchronization requirements
- Event-driven communication patterns[12][11]

## Requirements Engineering Process for Agentic Systems

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Goal Analysis

Instead of traditional requirements elicitation focusing on "what the system should do," agentic requirements engineering starts with "what outcomes stakeholders want to achieve".[13][2]

**Goal Discovery Techniques:**
1. **Outcome Mapping:** Map desired business outcomes to agent capabilities
2. **Scenario Analysis:** Define success scenarios rather than detailed workflows
3. **Constraint Identification:** Identify boundaries and limitations early
4. **Context Modeling:** Map environmental factors and triggers[2][4]

### Phase 2: Agent Behavior Specification

Define how agents should behave in various situations rather than prescribing exact actions.[14][15]

**Behavioral Requirements:**
- **Perception Requirements:** What information sources should agents monitor?
- **Reasoning Requirements:** How should agents process and interpret information?
- **Planning Requirements:** What planning algorithms and strategies should agents use?
- **Action Requirements:** What tools and capabilities should agents have access to?
- **Learning Requirements:** How should agents adapt and improve over time?[15][14]

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Coordination Design

For systems with multiple agents, define interaction patterns and coordination mechanisms.[9][5]

**Coordination Requirements:**
- **Communication Protocols:** Message formats, routing, and delivery guarantees
- **Task Allocation:** How work is distributed among agents
- **Conflict Resolution:** How agents handle disagreements or competing objectives
- **Shared State Management:** How agents maintain consistent world views[5][9]

### Phase 4: Safety and Governance Requirements

Agentic systems require robust safety mechanisms and governance frameworks.[11][4]

**Safety Requirements:**
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Real-time tracking of agent behavior
- **Circuit Breakers:** Automatic stops for unsafe situations
- **Human Oversight:** When and how humans intervene
- **Audit Trails:** Complete logging of agent decisions and actions[11][4]

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### 1. Data and Infrastructure Requirements

Agentic AI systems demand high-quality, governed data and robust infrastructure.[16][17]

**Data Requirements:**
- **Data Governance:** Access controls, privacy, and compliance
- **Data Quality:** Clean, structured, and contextualized data
- **Semantic Clarity:** Consistent data models and definitions
- **Real-time Access:** Low-latency data access for decision-making[17][16]

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- **Scalable Computing:** Support for distributed agent execution
- **Memory Systems:** Persistent memory for agent learning and context
- **Tool Integration:** APIs and connectors for external systems
- **Security Framework:** Authentication, authorization, and encryption[16][11]

### 2. Testing and Validation Requirements

Agentic systems require specialized testing approaches that differ from traditional software testing.[18][19]

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- **Multi-Agent Testing:** Coordinated validation across agent interactions
- **Behavioral Testing:** Validate agent behavior in various scenarios
- **Adaptive Testing:** Tests that evolve with agent learning
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end validation of agent ecosystems[19][18]

**Validation Criteria:**
- **Goal Achievement:** Measure success against defined objectives
- **Behavioral Consistency:** Ensure predictable agent behavior
- **Safety Compliance:** Validate adherence to constraints and boundaries
- **Performance Metrics:** Response times, accuracy, and resource utilization[18][19]

## Quality Assurance for Agentic Systems

### 1. Autonomous Quality Assurance

Traditional QA approaches must evolve to handle the dynamic nature of agentic systems.[20][21]

**QA Requirements:**
- **Self-Healing Capabilities:** Agents that can recover from failures
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time quality assessment
- **Adaptive Testing:** Test suites that evolve with system changes
- **Predictive Quality:** Early detection of potential issues[21][20]

### 2. Multi-Agent System Validation
