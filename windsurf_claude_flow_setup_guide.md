# Setting Up Claude Flow with Windsurf and GitHub Integration

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Claude Flow to work with Windsurf IDE and integrate with GitHub for autonomous code development.

## Step 1: Install Claude Code (Prerequisite)
```
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Activate Claude Code with permissions (this starts Claude code interface in the terminal, to )
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Step 2: Install Claude Flow Alpha
```
# Initialize Claude Flow with enhanced MCP setup
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
```

## Step 3: Configure Windsurf IDE
1. Open Windsurf IDE
2. Ensure Windsurf is configured to recognize the Claude Flow project directory
3. Claude Flow should automatically configure MCP servers for seamless integration with Windsurf

## Step 4: Set Up GitHub Integration
```
# Set up GitHub workflow orchestration
npx claude-flow@alpha github gh-coordinator analyze

# Configure repository synchronization
npx claude-flow@alpha github sync-coordinator align --multi-package
```

## Step 5: Create Your First Project
Choose the appropriate workflow based on your project complexity:
```
# For simpler tasks (recommended for most applications)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "build me a [your application]" --claude

# For complex projects requiring persistent sessions
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "build [your complex application]" --claude
```

## Step 6: Develop with Windsurf
1. Open your project in Windsurf IDE
2. Use Claude Flow's SPARC workflows for AI-guided development:
   ```
   npx claude-flow@alpha sparc workflow --phases "all" --ai-guided --memory-enhanced
   ```
3. Leverage Windsurf's features alongside Claude Flow's autonomous development capabilities

## Step 7: Sync with GitHub
Use Claude Flow's GitHub integration tools to manage your repository:
```
# For code reviews
npx claude-flow@alpha github pr-manager review --multi-reviewer --ai-powered

# For release management
npx claude-flow@alpha github release-manager coord --version x.x.x --auto-changelog
```

Claude Flow's integration with Windsurf should be seamless as it automatically configures the necessary MCP servers during initialization. The platform's advanced MCP tools and AI orchestration capabilities work well within the Windsurf environment.
