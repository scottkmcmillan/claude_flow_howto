# Using Claude Flow with Windsurf Throughout the Development Lifecycle

## Introduction

Claude Flow v2.0.0 Alpha is an enterprise-grade AI orchestration platform that revolutionizes how developers build with AI. It coordinates multiple Claude AI assistants to work simultaneously on different parts of your project through hive-mind swarm intelligence, neural pattern recognition, and 87 advanced MCP tools. This document outlines how you can leverage Claude Flow with Windsurf IDE throughout the entire development lifecycle.

Since launching Claude Flow Alpha 2.0 on July 7, 2025, the platform has significantly evolved, transforming from a structured development framework into a **fully autonomous, neural-enhanced AI orchestration system**. The integration represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI assistance to true swarm intelligence coordination.

## Prerequisites and Installation

### Prerequisites

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Claude Code must be installed first:

This installs and then starts Claude Code in a terminal. 
To continue installing Claude Flow, you need to open a new terminal and run the following commands.

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code globally 
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code 

# 2. Activate Claude Code with permissions 
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

> **Note**: When activating Claude Code for the first time, you may receive an authentication error. Follow the link provided in the terminal, complete the authentication process, then copy the code and paste it back into the terminal when prompted. Select option #1 if using subscription, or #2 if using API.

### Claude Flow Installation
Open a new terminal

```bash
# Use NPX for instant testing (recommended becaue it will then use the latest version of the software)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# Global installation (recommended for testing)
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha

# Verify installation
claude-flow --version  # Should show 2.0.0-alpha.53 or newer
```

> **Environment Recommendation**: For optimal performance, consider using GitHub Codespaces for running swarms rather than your local machine. Swarm operations can be resource-intensive and may overwhelm local systems. Linux environments provide better containerization but are still not ideal compared to cloud-based options.

### Enhanced Configuration

```bash
# Initialize with full alpha features
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force --hive-mind --neural-enhanced

# Configure Claude Code integration
npx claude-flow@alpha mcp setup --auto-permissions --87-tools

# Test hive-mind coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind test --agents 5 --coordination-test
```

### Quick Start Guide

```bash
# 1. Initialize Claude Flow with enhanced MCP setup
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# 2. Explore all revolutionary capabilities
npx claude-flow@alpha --help

# 3a. Quick AI coordination (recommended for most tasks)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "build me a REST API" --claude

# 3b. OR launch the full hive-mind system (for complex projects)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "build enterprise system" --claude
```
# View commands
```bash
ls .claude/commands/
```

#### Swarm vs Hive-Mind: Which to Use?

Quick Rule: Start with swarm for most tasks. Use hive-mind when you need persistent sessions or complex multi-agent coordination.

## Development Lifecycle with Claude Flow

### 1. Project Planning & Requirements Gathering

**Claude Flow Tools:**

# Hive Mind

!! run in a new interactive terminal session otherwise the wizard runs automatically without input

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard
```
Gives you more control over what the swarm will do

Hive mind is good at open ended and finds best solution for the problem

OR

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Define project requirements" \
  --agents architect,planner \
  --memory-namespace requirements \
  --claude
```
# Or Use a Swarm

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Create project roadmap" --claude
```

# Killing a Swarm or Hive-Mind

If you need to terminate a running swarm or hive-mind process, you have two options:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the destroy command
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind destroy --session-id <session-id>

# Option 2: In Claude Code terminal
# Simply type a message like: "Please stop the current swarm/hive-mind process"
```

## Advanced Features for Development Lifecycle

### SPARC 2.0: Revolutionary Code Agent Architecture

Claude Flow now implements the enhanced SPARC 2.0 methodology, which has evolved into an **intelligent coding agent framework** that combines secure execution environments, vector similarity matching, version control, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities. The system employs a **ReACT (Reason + Act) strategy** where agents first reason about code meaning before taking appropriate actions.

The enhanced SPARC methodology maintains its original phases—**Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion**—but now executes them through coordinated AI agents rather than sequential manual processes. Each phase is managed by specialized agents that collaborate through an intelligent memory system backed by SQLite databases.

Key features include:
- **Unified diff system** that captures precise changes between code versions
- **Vector store** that transforms code into abstract patterns, capturing underlying meaning
- **Neural pattern recognition** with 512KB WASM core module featuring SIMD acceleration
- **27+ cognitive models** with pattern recognition and adaptive behavior

### Web Interface for Monitoring

```
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm monitor --dashboard --real-time
```

Access the web dashboard to monitor agent activity, track progress, and manage task coordination while working in Windsurf.

### Swarm Mode for Complex Projects

```
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "build, test, and deploy my application"
```

Use swarm mode for large-scale projects to coordinate hundreds of agents simultaneously, handling complex, multi-phase development cycles.

### Memory System for Context Preservation

Claude Flow's persistent memory system (.swarm/memory.db with 12 specialized tables) allows agents to share knowledge across sessions, maintaining context between different development sessions while you work in Windsurf.

```
# Check what's stored in memory
npx claude-flow@alpha memory stats
npx claude-flow@alpha memory list

# Query specific memories
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "authentication" --recent --limit 5

# Store memories with namespaces for organization
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "project requirements" --save --namespace requirements

# Your project structure after initialization:
# .hive-mind/ <- Contains config.json + SQLite session data
# .swarm/ <- Contains memory.db (SQLite database)
# memory/ <- Agent-specific memories (created when agents spawn)
# coordination/ <- Active workflow files (created during tasks)
```

### Hooks System: Automated Lifecycle Management

Claude Flow now includes a **comprehensive hooks system** that integrates seamlessly with Claude Code's lifecycle events. The system provides **14 fully implemented hook types** that offer complete lifecycle management across all development operations:

**Pre-Operation Hooks**:
- **pre-task**: Automatic agent assignment based on task complexity
- **pre-edit**: File validation, backup, and conflict checking
- **pre-command**: Security validation and permission checks

**Post-Operation Hooks**:
- **post-edit**: Auto-formatting, memory updates, and neural training
- **post-task**: Performance analysis and insights generation
- **post-command**: Output analysis and metrics tracking

**Session Management Hooks**:
- **session-start**: Context loading and memory restoration
- **session-end**: Metrics export and summary generation
- **session-restore**: Previous session state recovery

```bash
# Configure hooks for automated workflows
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks configure --pre-commit "run tests"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks list
```

## Real-World Applications

### Rapid Prototyping

Use Claude Flow with Windsurf to quickly build prototypes and proof-of-concept applications. The multi-agent approach can handle everything from initial architecture design to deployment in a fraction of the time it would take manually.

## Workflow Patterns for Development

### 🚀 Pattern 1: Single Feature Development
```
# Initialize once per feature/task
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# Spawn hive for feature development
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Implement user authentication" \
  --agents coder,tester,security-specialist \
  --claude

# Continue working on SAME feature (reuse existing hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind status
npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "authentication" --recent
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Add password reset functionality" --continue-session
```

### 🏗️ Pattern 2: Multi-Feature Project
```
# Project-level initialization (once per project)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force --project-name "my-app"

# Feature 1: Authentication (new hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "auth-system" --namespace auth --claude

# Feature 2: User management (separate hive)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "user-management" --namespace users --claude

# Resume Feature 1 later (use session ID from spawn output)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

### 🔄 Pattern 3: Session Recovery After Crash
```
# After a crash or taking a break, restart Claude Code
claude -c --dangerously-skip-permissions

To resume a hive-mind, simply task Claude in the Claude prompt bar to resumeusing the swarm session ID#
```

```bash
resume swarm-1752982630821-ecql1pzwj to continue the development
```

Or simply
In the input line, explain what happened and request to continue
Example: "continue spawning the swarm for the authentication system"


The **Hive Mind Resume system** provides enterprise-grade persistence to swarm operations. Sessions are automatically created with progress saved every 30 seconds, allowing seamless interruption and resume with complete context preservation.
